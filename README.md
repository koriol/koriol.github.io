## Practicing
personal website repo practice

### Edit and commit your README.md file
Commit changes to a new branch and open a pull request. Merge pull request.

### Create a pull request with a more descriptive title.
Copare and pull request in the upper right green button

### Link this pull request to the project and update the status of this item
To ensure the project board automatically tracks the progress of the website, choose the project created on the right side of the pull request from the Projects section. Update the status of this item to "In Progress"

### Update the pull request when appropriate.
The description is not static. When you first create a pull request, you may have a list of things you want to do before merging the code into the main branch. Make sure to always revisit the description and make sure it is accurate.
