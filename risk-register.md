# Risk Register
## Introduction
This portfolio entry demonstrates a comprehensive Risk Assessment of a Mathnasium Learning Center using the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF). By categorizing the system under FIPS 199, I identified 31 specific risks across physical and digital domains and developed a prioritized remediation roadmap.

### Quick View
Total Risks Identified: 31 | Critical/High Risks: 8 | Top Information Type: Student PII (Moderate)

### Risk Distribution
This shows the executive how we are defending the center.
| Function | Count | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <span style="color:blue">Preventive</span> | 18 | Stopping unauthorized access before it happens. |
| <span style="color:gold">Detective</span> | 7 | Identifying gaps and monitoring current activity. |
| <span style="color:purple">Corrective</span> | 6 | Ensuring data can be recovered after an event. |
